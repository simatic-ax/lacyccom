## Description
The following section shows a scenario for a possible application of the LAcycCom
library:

With acyclic data exchange, contrary to cyclic communication, data transfer takes 
place when an explicit request is made, e.g. in order to read and write drive object 
parameters. Acyclic parameter access occurs parallel to the cyclic process data 
exchange. This saves resources, since the data is only requested on demand, i. e. 
when a parameter has to be transferred.
The "Read data record" and "Write data record" services are available for acyclic 
data exchange.
According to the PROFIdrive profile, for drives in conformance with PROFIdrive, 
only one DPV1 (asynchronous PROFIBUS communication) request is permissible 
for each drive object and control unit for non-cyclic (acyclic) communication 
(parameter requests). If two or more DPV1 requests are simultaneously issued to a 
drive unit, conflicts can occur when processing the request in the drive unit. These 
conflicts then cause the different DPV1 requests to mutually interfere with one 
another. In order to prevent that such bus conflict occurs, it is the userâ€™s
responsibility to avoid that and a check must be made for each new DPV1 request 
whether another request is already active on the drive object involved. This is 
certainly the case if system functions are also used that are not exclusively 
intended to communicate to drive units via DPV1 services.
In order to relieve the user of this task a request management called Resource 
Manager exists that handles the management of DPV1 services for the user. This 
function is presented here. However, the introduction of this request management 
assumes as prerequisite that each function, which utilizes DPV1 services, will also 
actually use them.
